# creating_customer_segments_with_arvato
The data and design for this project were provided by Arvato Financial Services. I will apply unsupervised learning techniques on demographic and spending data for a sample of German households. I will preprocess the data, apply dimensionality reduction techniques, and implement clustering algorithms to segment customers with the goal of optimizing customer outreach for a mail order company.
